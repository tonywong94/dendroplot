# Scripts used in [Wong et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac723a)

To reproduce the main results of this paper, you should download from the [data repository](https://doi.org/10.13012/B2IDB-1671495_V1) these files:

- images250.zip
- structures250.zip
- filaments.zip

Create two subdirectories `images` and `struct` inside this directory (`wong2022`) and unpack the first ZIP file in `images` and the other two in `struct`.  The main scripts to run are numbered and will output the LTE results in `lte` and the dendrogram results in `dendro`.  These should essentially match the corresponding results already provided in the `images` and `struct` directories.  Additional scripts can largely be run using the existing output in `struct`.  More details about the tables and figures in the paper are given below.

- Tables 1-4: these are generated by `DendroTables.ipynb`.

- Table 5: the data are generated by `2-dendro_30dor_250.py` which writes a few TeX files.

- Figure 1: this is generated by `Fluxspectra-250.ipynb`, although not all data sets are currently in the repository (they are available by request).

- Figure 2: this is generated by `plot_snrpk_250.py`.

- Figure 3: the right two panels are also generated by `plot_snrpk_250.py`.

- Figure 4: the top panels are generated by `plot_clust_250.py`.  The bottom panel is generated by `ClusterTree.ipynb`.

- Figures 5,6,7: the plots for the 0.25 km/s channel cubes are generated by `3-doplots_30dor_250.py`.

- Figure 8: this is generated by `clusterbnd.py` after `cluster12_overlap.py` is run.  Note that the latter script requires an `asgn.fits.gz` cube which was inadvertently omitted from the data repository.  This can be regenerated with `2-dendro_30dor_250.py`.

- Figures 9,10: these are generated by `3-doplots_30dor_250.py`.

- Figure 11: this is generated by `refdist_plots.py`.

- Figure 12: this is generated by `Dendros_on_fils.ipynb`.
